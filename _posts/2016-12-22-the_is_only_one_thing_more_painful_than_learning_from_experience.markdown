is not learning from experience." (Archibald McLeish)

I’ve been trying to teach myself coding for a while now, and the convention historically has been to major at college and to complete a Computer Science degree, then get a job.  The new disrupter for IT professionals is using online schools, “bootcamps” or even becoming self-taught.  I’ve tried each of these, and presently I’m self-teaching again.

I started a 12 week (fulltime) “full-stack boot camp” in May. I’d done the prep work required and paid my hefty tuition and was excited to be educated, naively expecting to learn years of wisdom much the same way Neo learns jui-jitsu.  

I found the experience enlightening, but not for the expected reasons; I quit after 2 weeks, having assured myself that I was totally unprepared and incapable of assimilating that intensity of novel, complex and cumulative information each day for another 10 weeks.

*“… The thing that I think is the most frustrating about programming is you battle with a concept or feature or tool for a long time, and while you’re battling, it feels like you’re never gonna get it.
And then you get it. 
And then it feels obvious.*

*I feel like there’s a very small amount of time, maybe like 5 seconds, where you feel good about it.
90% of it is spent where you feel angry, and stupid.
9% is spent feeling like “oh, obviously.”
And there’s 1% of happiness.”*

I just completed another Code Camp, a much more conventional overview of web development coding.  It was gratifying, and the milieu and instruction was, primarily, designed around being supportive.  We met once a week, and followed an online WebDev course.

I just finished my first major project a month ago, collaborating with a fellow student.  Though we are nowhere near Developers, this time - unlike “amateurs” - we were paid for our time.  And we hope to find more projects.

We practiced what we were taught, and had to learn a ton more, in a real-world setting.  I must confess that like Saron Yitbarek, success produces a terribly fleeting sense of competence and happiness.

But … it also includes creating a website.
