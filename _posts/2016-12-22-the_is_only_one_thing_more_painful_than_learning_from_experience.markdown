is not learning from experience." (Archibald McLeish)

I’ve been trying to teach myself coding for a while now, and the convention historically has been to major in Computer Science, then get a job.  The new disrupter for IT aspirants is completing online schools, “bootcamps” or even becoming self-taught.  I’ve tried each of these, and presently I’m self-teaching, when I can't make headway on this platform.

And this ain't my first toe in the water.  I started a 12 week (fulltime) “full-stack boot camp” in May. I’d done the prep work required and paid my hefty tuition and was excited to be educated, naively expecting to learn years of wisdom much the same way Neo learns jui-jitsu.  

Here was my experience of moving from "preparation" to the actual full-time course:

Let's summarize that I found the experience enlightening. I quit after 2 weeks, having assured myself that I was totally unprepared and incapable of assimilating that intensity of novel, complex and cumulative information each day for another 10 weeks.


Following that agitation, I completed a Code Camp in September, a much more conventional overview of web development coding.  It was gratifying, and the milieu and instruction was, primarily, designed around being supportive.  We met once a week for 3 months, and followed an online WebDev course curriculum.  It was entirely different than the bootcamp.

So now I have radically different perspectives, but I do have one unifying opinion:

*“… The thing that I think is the most frustrating about programming is you battle with a concept or feature or tool for a long time, and while you’re battling, it feels like you’re never gonna get it.
And then you get it. 
And then it feels obvious.*

*I feel like there’s a very small amount of time, maybe like 5 seconds, where you feel good about it.
90% of it is spent where you feel angry, and stupid.
9% is spent feeling like “oh, obviously.”
And there’s 1% of happiness.”*

*Saron Yitbarek, founder of CodeNewbie (http://learntocodewith.me/podcast/coding-bootcamp-to-microsoft-with-saron-yitbarek/)*

I finished my first major project a month ago, collaborating with a fellow student.  Though we are nowhere near Developers, this time - unlike “amateurs” - we were paid for our time, to make a small-business website responsive.  We practiced what we were taught, and had to learn a ton more, in a real-world setting.  

Like Saron Yitbarek said, our success did produce that terribly fleeting sense of competence and happiness.

But … it also includes creating a website.
