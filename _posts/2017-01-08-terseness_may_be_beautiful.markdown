"The Community" of programmers is an amazingly generous tribe of folks.  Flatiron pays folks to help make the system run (and to write and improve curriculum, etc!) and those folks are kind and patient but ... I'm not talking about them.  I lucked into a fantastic mentor the other day.  He'd helped me before and I DM'd him to ask if I was anywhere near the right path on the damn Tic Tac Toe mindboggle.  

At one point during the 4 (FOUR!) hours of mentoring, Drew commented that I could clean up my code a little, and suggested a simplified syntax.   I stared at what he'd written, my brain whining and losing momentum, underpowered up the hill he'd just conjured on a whim.

"You think the solution is way more complex than it is sometimes. It's simple simple."

Perhaps.  I hope so.  

At another point, he said that programmers see terseness as beautiful.  I understand what Drew means, and I want to eventually acquire the ability to be terse, and write beautiful code.  
Right now, I'm still staring at the huge black monolith, wondering WTF.
