At the granular level, how I came to Programming was, as they say, my *choice* but that doesn't mean I consciously directed my life to crescendo, at this moment, at this particular juncture.  Instead, I just arrived here, at the intersection of serendipity and inclination.

After college+, I traveled and worked 6-12 month jobs overseas for a few years, before landing back in Florida, to help with Outward Bound's adjudicated-youth program.  I loved the Project Step program - solid(!) idealistic young do-gooders all - but the pittance, and 18 months of lightning storms and hurricanes, solid walls of mosquitos, less than 300' of state topography and 30-day canoe convoys paddling with 11 adjudicated boys and 2 other instructors, down the tea-colored Suwanee, Withlacoochee, St. Johns and Georgia's Altamaha, I grew burnt in the Sunshine State. ![](http://i.imgur.com/K25jXue.jpg)So, my fulfillment, struggling alongside troubled youth, plus promises of better financial compensation drew me to Utah (huh?!), and to my next 15 years of "wilderness therapy" (which is the wealthier kid's version of Project STEP), instructing, field directing and finally marketing the program I helped build, but didn't own.  When the company unwound and my job as "company mascot" (Outreach Director) evaporated, I found myself anxiously adrift, and quickly committed to "retooling" for another long career!

That's why I decided to learn software development.  To be totally honest, I actually fell for the garish parade of unscrupulous marketing that one "can learn coding in 3 months" and "make 6 figures starting out, maybe even with Google or Facebook!"  I'm relatively smart, and I like computers' certainty and after 15 years living in the greys of therapeutic programs, I wanted the concrete clarity of digital certainty. Plus, the knowledge and confidence that jobs are waiting *is* enticing.  I assumed it wouldn't be that hard, especially if I earnestly\* committed to 520 hours of mentored learning!

After discovering a truth about code - it's absolutely baffling! - a better question might be why do I continue?  
I like Flatiron's frank admission, right in the first paragraphs but throughout the curriculum, social media content and interviews, that learning code is very hard, at first.  
I like the collaboration of this program's community.  I've found self-teaching to be tremendously solitary and believe this is a better way, for me.
My path seems less steep and the views are more inspiring, when there are laughing voices and supportive waves along the hike.

So thank you, "community" and please continue to strike up conversations and offer tips, slightly-relevant distractions and camaraderie on our journey.
